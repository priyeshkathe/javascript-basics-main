# The Master Architect (Pure JavaScript)
## Bringing the Web to Life: DOM & Logic

Welcome to the **DOM & Logic** practice repository! This module transforms you from a "designer" to an "engineer" - you'll learn to control every pixel and behavior on a webpage using JavaScript.

---

## 📚 Module Overview

**JavaScript is the brain of the web.** While HTML is the skeleton and CSS is the skin, JS is the nervous system. In this module, you'll master the **Document Object Model (DOM)** - the programming interface that allows JavaScript to add, remove, and change HTML and CSS in real-time.

## 🎯 Key Learnings

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **DOM Hierarchy** | Mastering `querySelector` and `getElementById` to target any element |
| **Event Architecture** | Deep dive into `click`, `input`, and `submit` events |
| **Dynamic Styling** | Using `element.classList` to trigger CSS animations via JS |
| **State Management** | Using variables and arrays to track data locally |
| **Modern ES6+ Syntax** | Arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring |

2. **Type the code yourself** - don't copy-paste
3. **Use console.log()** - debug and understand what's happening
4. **Make mistakes** - learning comes from debugging
5. **Complete all exercises** - practice makes perfect
6. **Ask questions** - if stuck, seek help
